    "Marketing Lead Management allows marketing professionals to define and maintain rules for lead scores and lead stages without support from business analysts or data scientists.",
    "Marketers can fine-tune scores together with sales and create lead stages based on company-specific requirements. Optional integration with SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C) or SAP CRM allows progression of leads to action stages with full visibility of success back from the Campaign level.",
    "This document provides a detailed procedure for testing this scope item after solution activation, reflecting the predefined scope of the solution. Each process step, report, or item is covered in its own section, providing the system interactions (test steps) in a table view. Steps that are not in scope of the process but are needed for testing are marked accordingly. Project-specific steps must be added."
